# 🎲 Pig Game  

A simple two-player dice game built using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. This was one of my first fully built JavaScript projects, helping me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic.  

## 🎮 How to Play  
- Players take turns rolling a die.  
- If the player rolls a **1**, their turn ends, and they lose any points accumulated in that turn.  
- If they roll **2-6**, they can either:  
  - **Hold** to add their turn points to their total score and pass the turn.  
  - **Roll again** to risk getting a 1 and losing their turn points.  
- First player to reach **50 points** wins!  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- JavaScript  
- HTML  
- CSS

## 📌 Lessons I Learned  
- JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation  
- Handling game state and player turns  
- Implementing basic game logic
